# ASV and CM optimization with REINFORCE

Speaker verification and spoofing countermeasure systems are trained independent, but used together.
What if we optimize them together for the tandem task?

This repository contains the code for replicating experiments in [TODO paper link] 

## Requirements
* PyTorch (experiments ran on v1.3.1)
* [Kaldi](https://kaldi-asr.org/) and [PyKaldi](https://github.com/pykaldi/pykaldi) for extracting features

## TODOs

1) Include necessary python code and clean up
2) Include necessary scripts
3) Include instructions / new scripts for the feature extraction phase
